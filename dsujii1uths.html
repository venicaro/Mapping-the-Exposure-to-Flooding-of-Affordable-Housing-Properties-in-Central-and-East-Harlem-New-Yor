In order to map the H&amp;A properties in current and future floodplain, I firstly obtained Excel files of all the properties directly by the Community Development Corporations (CDCs). I decided that my unit of work should be the Borough-Block-Lot (BBL) a unique parcel number&nbsp; assigned to each property. I then followed these steps:</div><div>Select by location properties within each floodplain (x4 times)</div><div>Exported the attribute table in Excel in order to calculate the Yearly Rate of Change across properties and floodplains</div><div>Created 1 overall map showing color coded properties in relation to floodplains.
