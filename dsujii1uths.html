<h3 data-label="926318" class="ltx_title_subsubsection"><b>Author's statement of overarching rationale</b></h3><div>I believe that universities (private and public) should serve citizens' interests and bridge the disparity in knowledge available to community groups that have less resources to access tools/software/data to build effective arguments against both the systemic forces of history (struggles for affordable housing, better living conditions and the myriads of events and practices of life) and the - no longer - extraordinary climate-induced events like coastal and stormwater flooding.</div><div></div><div></div><h2 data-label="686110" class="ltx_title_subsection">Research Plan </h2><div>The research plan followed these steps. In order to map the H&amp;A properties in current and future floodplain, I firstly obtained Excel files of all the properties directly by the Community Development Corporations (CDCs). I decided that my unit of work should be the Borough-Block-Lot (BBL) a unique parcel number&nbsp; assigned to each property. I then followed these steps:</div><div>Select by location properties within each floodplain (x4 times)</div><div>Exported the attribute table in Excel in order to calculate the Yearly Rate of Change across properties and floodplains.</div><div> I used online satellite imagery and basemaps to render the context of Central and East Harlem. I created 1 overall map showing color coded properties in relation to floodplains. Additionally I generated 4 small multiple maps to show zoom-ins of interesting locations in each floodplain. I repeated steps above in order  to compare H&amp;A properties with yearly rate of change of all buildings in Central and East Harlem (C&amp;EH) and I generated 1 map overlaying C&amp;EH properties and current and project floodplains. I made a different data frame, clipping it to the two community districts. To calculate the topographic elevation I used the 2018 1 foot DEM raster for the whole of New York City and performed&nbsp; a Zonal Statistics as Table to calculate mean elevation of each flooded and not flooded H&amp;A BBL. I then generated 1 more map</div><div> showing mean elevation of flooded and not flooded buildings. Under symbology I d</div>
