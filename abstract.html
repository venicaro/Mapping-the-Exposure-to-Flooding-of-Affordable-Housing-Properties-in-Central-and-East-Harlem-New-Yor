<div>New York City’s affordable housing stock is vulnerable to coastal flooding under current and projected climate scenarios. Flood risk in this study, was intended as a factor of the exposure of affordable housing buildings to current and future floodplains inf. The affordable housing in question is owned by two community-development corporations (CDC), Hope and Ascendant, based in East Harlem. Using GIS software and publicly available data from NYC Open Data and Mapluto, large scale mapping was conducted at the Borough-Block-Lot (BBL) scale and results show that Hope Properties may flood more than Ascendants, under current and future floodplain projections. Hope's yearly rate of change of buildings that may flood is also double than that of all the other buildings in East Harlem. A contributing factor is topographical elevation, where&nbsp;Hope Properties are at lower median elevation (13.2 feet) than Ascendants' (29 feet) and also lower than the median elevation of both Central (22 feet) and East Harlem (15 feet). This result is important considering that New York City’s stock of affordable housing hosts some of the most vulnerable populations in the city, with less ability to move elsewhere before or after a flooding event.</div>
