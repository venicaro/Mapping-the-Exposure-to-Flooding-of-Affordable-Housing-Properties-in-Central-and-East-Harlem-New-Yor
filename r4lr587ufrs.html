More specifically 9 out of 157 (6%) are at 95% and 13 out of 157 (8%) are at 99% confidence level. Among those, 5 out of 28 of AND properties are at 90-99% confidence level, while of the 20 out of 28 of HOPE properties, are at 90-99% confidence level. Hproperties are not just more exposed to coastal flooding but they are also more vulnerable because their BBLs feature more among those that are affected by changes in rezoning, rent subsidy expiration and higher rates of low- income residents.</div><div></div><div></div>
