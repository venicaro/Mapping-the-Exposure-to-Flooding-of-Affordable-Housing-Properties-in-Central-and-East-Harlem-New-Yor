<div></div><div>This mapping project aims to answers the following questions:&nbsp;</div><ol><li>How many Hope and Ascendant properties are in the current and future floodplain?</li><li>How do Hope and Ascendant buildings compare with the rest of the buildings in Manhattan?</li><li>What is the average elevation of flooded and not flooded BBL under different floodplains?</li></ol><div></div><div>The results and final map(s) were shared with all staff at Hope and Ascendant as a tool for advocacy around issues of flooding of their properties. The project understood that, so far, violations descriptions are not capturing important information about whether the violation is issued as a result of the inability of inspectors to access the basement due to to flooding (see Study Limitations).&nbsp; A short protocol for Hope and Ascendant Property managers is produced to use in order to file more accurate descriptions of violations occurring as&nbsp; consequence of flooding. The long term dream is&nbsp;                  to be able to quantify the hidden recurrent costs due to basement flooding that add to the burden of regular maintenance costs.    &nbsp;</div><div></div><div></div>
