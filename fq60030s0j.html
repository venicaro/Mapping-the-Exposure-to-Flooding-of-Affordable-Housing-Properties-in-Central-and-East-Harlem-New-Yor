<div></div><div>This mapping project aims to answers the following questions:&nbsp;</div><ol><li>How many Hope and Ascendant properties are in the current and future floodplain?</li><li>How do Hope and Ascendant buildings compare with the rest of the buildings in Manhattan?</li><li>What is the average elevation of flooded and not flooded BBL under different floodplains?</li></ol><div></div><div>The results and final map(s) were shared with all staff at Hope and Ascendant as a tool for advocacy around issues of flooding of their properties. Initially I thought it  was going to be possible to access data on occurrence of flooding in  basements from the building manager service&nbsp;<a href="https://sitecompli.com/" target="_blank">SiteCompli</a>.  This website contains information about the violations that both  organization incur year round since 2012. A close inspection of the data  contained revealed that violations are filed for issues such as "sewer  backup" but no further explanation is given about whether the violation  was filed because inspectors could not access the basement. The number  of complaints&nbsp; related to sewer backup was also too small to warrant  visualization through GIS mapping (36 complaint between 2010 and 2018).  The project understood that, so far, violations descriptions are not capturing important information about whether the violation is issued as a result of the inability of inspectors to access the basement due to to flooding.&nbsp; A short protocol for Hope and Ascendant Property managers will be produced  in order to file more accurate descriptions of violations occurring as&nbsp; consequence of flooding. The long term dream is&nbsp;                  to be able to quantify the hidden recurrent costs due to basement flooding that add to the burden of regular maintenance costs.    &nbsp;</div><div></div><div></div>
