Riverine floods are the least common and least severe type in NYC.&nbsp;Inland floods (flash floods) are caused by stormwater. These floods are difficult to predict and manage as their occurrence is driven by small intense thunderstorms, local land characteristics, and the complex sewer network. Coastal and riverine flood risk can be defined using FEMA flood maps for the 100-year storm, but inland flood risk and vulnerability are difficult to quantify. NYC manages this risk through several mechanisms including: regulatory codes and laws, stormwater management improvements, flood-proofing and elevating buildings, and protecting critical infrastructure&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{mitigation}</cite>.</div><div></div><div>NYC has experienced 7.5-foot floods several times in the past  decade. Superstorm Sandy loosed 10- or 11-foot floods on much of  Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Staten Island,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/11/17/nyregion/hurricane-sandy-map.html" target="_blank">killing 43 people</a> and inundating more than 88,000 buildings&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{atlantic2017}</cite>.

Geo-spatial technologies are used to estimate the risk of occurrence of a disaster based on physical and/or social dimensions. These two dimension are brought together in the concept of risk, which is a function of exposure, social vulnerability and the ability to recover of different social groups to flooding&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Ka_mierczak_2011}</cite>.&nbsp; Although there may be many variables influencing exposure to floods, here I refer to exposure as the susceptibility to being affected by an environmental related hazard&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Cutter_2005,Cutter_2012}</cite>, such as a flood event, based on area topography, proximity to the floodplain and rainfall trends. </div>
