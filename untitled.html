Riverine floods are the least common and least severe type in NYC.&nbsp;Inland floods (flash floods) are caused by stormwater. These floods are difficult to predict and manage as their occurrence is driven by small intense thunderstorms, local land characteristics, and the complex sewer network. Coastal and riverine flood risk can be defined using FEMA flood maps for the 100-year storm, but inland flood risk and vulnerability are difficult to quantify. NYC manages this risk through several mechanisms including: regulatory codes and laws, stormwater management improvements, floodproofing and elevating buildings, and protecting critical infrastructure&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{mitigation}</cite></div><div></div><div>GIS and remote sensing are critical tools for analyzing, preparing for, mitigating, and responding to natural and human-induced disasters, including from flooding events&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Huang_2009}</cite><cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Strobl_2012}</cite>. Geospatial technologies are used to estimate the risk of occurrence of a disaster based on physical and/or social dimensions. These two dimension are brought together in the concept of risk, which is a function of exposure, social vulnerability and the ability to recover of different social groups to flooding&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Ka_mierczak_2011}</cite>.&nbsp; Although there may be many variables influencing exposure to floods, including Here I refer to exposure as the susceptibility to being affected by aclimate hazard, such as a flood event, based on topography and proximity to the floodplain.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Hope community Incorporated&nbsp; and Ascendant are two community-based not-for-profit affordable housing organization based in East and Central Harlem. Hope’s mission is to “rebuild the physical infrastructure of East Harlem by creating attractive, high-quality affordable rental and owner-occupied housing. Hope seeks to strengthen the neighborhood's social fabric by assisting in the growth and success of local businesses, by assisting residents to enhance their lives and incomes, and by sponsoring community programs”.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><a href="http://www.hopeci.org/content/property-management">Hope’s Property Management Department services</a> is a Community-Development Corporation (CDC), owns over 1,300 affordable apartments in more than 78 buildings throughout East Harlem (Community District 11). Hope Community expressed the need for evidence-based mapping to understand the exposure to flooding and other risks of their 78 buildings and the people living in them. Following a meeting with a community educator and previous graduate of the New School, one of the main problems seems to be ‘blue sky flooding’, the type of flooding occurring without stormy weather and influenced by high tides and high ground water table. This type of flooding affects basements, which are recurrently flooded, but for which Hope has very little funding for left over after what goes towards regular building maintenance. Moreover, Hope has been receiving a number of <a href="http://www.ewa.bh/en/Customer/MeterReading/violations">violations</a> from the energy company because it is in the basements that the gas and water readings are stored and because of flooding officers were unable to do a proper meter reading. Because of these violations, Hope has been unable to close housing retrofitting deals with the for-profit-banks they partner with. At the same time Hope has been an early adopter of green rooftops thanks to funding made available by the city, however green rooftops address a different problem: they slow down excess rainfall but they do not slow down water coming from below. An evidence-based large-scale mapping exercise for Hope would then need to make a case for the problems encountered by Hope by visualizing the hidden recurrent costs due to basement flooding as well as regular maintenance costs. </div>
