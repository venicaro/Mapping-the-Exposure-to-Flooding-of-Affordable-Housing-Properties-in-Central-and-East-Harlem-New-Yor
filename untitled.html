Riverine floods are the least common and least severe type in NYC.&nbsp;Inland floods (flash floods) are caused by stormwater. These floods are difficult to predict and manage as their occurrence is driven by small intense thunderstorms, local land characteristics, and the complex sewer network. Coastal and riverine flood risk can be defined using FEMA flood maps for the 100-year storm, but inland flood risk and vulnerability are difficult to quantify. NYC manages this risk through several mechanisms including: regulatory codes and laws, stormwater management improvements, floodproofing and elevating buildings, and protecting critical infrastructure&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{mitigation}</cite></div><div></div><div>GIS and remote sensing are critical tools for analyzing, preparing for, mitigating, and responding to natural and human-induced disasters, including from flooding events&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Huang_2009}</cite> Geospatial technologies are used to estimate the risk of occurrence of a disaster based on physical and/or social (in the case of war fo example) disasters.&nbsp;</div>
