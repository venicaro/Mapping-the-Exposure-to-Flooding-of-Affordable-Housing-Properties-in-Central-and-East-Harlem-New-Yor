Or in GIS terms does a raster cell with high volume of complaints also display high flood levels?</div><ul><div>  </div><li>I created a table that      correlates rainfall data on a daily/weekly or monthly basis, where a higher      than mean complaints means they often happen when wet month occurs.</li><div>  </div><li>In terms of complaints, the more you are      able to extract related to sewer backup issues from SiteComply the better,      like in the thousands. They can also include Ascendant buildings if they      use it too. If there's not as many then I'd need to compare what's there      with 311 data set for the 5 boroughs and compare it with east harlem.</li><div> </div></ul><div></div>
