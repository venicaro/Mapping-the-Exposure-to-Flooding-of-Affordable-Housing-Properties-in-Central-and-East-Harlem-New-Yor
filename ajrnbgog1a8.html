<div><b>Methods &amp; Analysis</b></div><div>In order to understand the vulnerability to coastal and stormwater flooding in Hope and Ascendant properties I illustrate two major relations to understand properties' exposure to floods and one correlation to understand properties vulnerability. The first relation is between the number of properties located in the current&nbsp;and future NYC floodplains, the second relation is between properties' exposure to current and future coastal flooding and the influence o&nbsp; topographic elevation of Central and East Harlem,</div><div></div><div> FEMA defined floodplain and the future floodplain as projected by the New York Panel on Climate Change (NYPCC, 2014) flood maps (20, 50, 80, 100 year floodplain).</div><div></div><div><b>Map 1 Flood Exposure in East Harlem focusing on Hope Properties </b>answers the question: “How many Hope properties (BBL scale) are in the current and future floodplain?</div><ul><div>  </div><li>Map will show the BBL overlaying Hope      properties as data points (after I geo-locate those included in the file      you sent me) </li><div>  </div><li>I'll use NEW York City DEM (1 foot)      integer raster </li></ul><div></div><div><b>Map 1 - Process flow: </b></div><div>Geo-locate Hope Properties on Carto</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><b>Data: </b></div><div>NEW York City DEM (1 foot) integer raster 3.3.gb (if problem go back to 30m)</div><div>Tax lot (BBL) for NYC (csv file)</div><div>Current floodplain (FEMA)</div><div>2050 floodplain (NYCC 2014)</div><div>Manhattan – East Harlem shapefile</div>
