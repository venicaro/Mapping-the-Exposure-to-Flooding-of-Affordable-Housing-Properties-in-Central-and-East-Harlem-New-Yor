<div><b>Methods &amp; Analysis</b></div><div>In order to understand the vulnerability to coastal and stormwater flooding in Hope and Ascendant properties I illustrate two major relations to understand properties' exposure to floods and one correlation to understand properties vulnerability. The first relation is between the number of properties located in the current&nbsp;and future NYC floodplains, the second relation is between properties' exposure to current and future coastal flooding and the influence of topographic elevation of Central and East Harlem. Finally I will correlate the number of 311 service calls relating to flooding (filtered by ...) with&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>The first map displays the number of Hope and Ascendant properties mapped at the Building Block scale that are in the current (2015) FEMA defined floodplain and the future floodplain as projected by the New York Panel on Climate Change (NYPCC, 2014) flood maps (20, 50, 80, 100 year floodplain).</div><ul><div>  </div></ul><div><b>Map 1 - Process flow:&nbsp;</b></div><div>Retrieved property data from Hope (not geolocated and with&nbsp; Ascendant (already geo-located but with projection issues)</div><div>Recoded BBL numbers for both properties from scratch through padding numbers and concatenation</div><div></div><div>Geo-located Hope and Ascendant Properties using Carto</div><div>Defined projections of both shapefiles to match Long Island 2263</div><div></div><div>Table join on BBLs&nbsp; (search only 11 and 10)</div><div>what is not joined is null </div><div>select null and then inverse</div><div>export shapefiel</div><div></div><div></div><div>extract the 100 yr floodplain</div><div>Loaded the NYPCC 100yr 2020 floodplain shapefile and defined projection</div><div>Loaded the NYC Shoreline and defined projection</div><div>Clipped both shoreline and NYPCC 100yr 2020 floodplain to Central and East Harlem districts</div><div></div><div>spatial overlay or intersection with property</div><div>properties at risk % increase  (going back to original number to calculate increase</div><div></div><div>Overlaid Manhattan – Central and East Harlem shapefiles</div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div>Retrieved FEMA 2015 floodplain&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><b>Data: </b></div><div>NEW York City DEM (1 foot) integer raster 3.3.gb (if problem go back to 30m)</div><div>Tax lot (BBL) for NYC (csv file)</div><div>Current floodplain (FEMA)</div><div>2050 floodplain (NYCC 2014)</div><div>Manhattan – East Harlem shapefile</div>
