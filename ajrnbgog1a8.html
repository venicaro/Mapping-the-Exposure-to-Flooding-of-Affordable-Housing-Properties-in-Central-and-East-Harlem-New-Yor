<div><b>Methods &amp; Analysis</b></div><div>In order to understand the vulnerability to coastal and stormwater flooding in Hope and Ascendant properties I illustrate two major relations to understand properties' exposure to floods and one correlation to understand properties vulnerability. The first relation is between the number of properties located in the current&nbsp;and future NYC floodplains, the second relation is between properties' exposure to current and future coastal flooding and the influence of topographic elevation of Central and East Harlem. Finally I will correlate the number of 311 service calls relating to flooding (filtered by ...) with&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>The first map displays the number of Hope and Ascendant properties mapped at the Building Block scale that are in the current (2015) FEMA defined floodplain and the future floodplain as projected by the New York Panel on Climate Change (NYPCC, 2014) flood maps (20, 50, 80, 100 year floodplain).</div><ul><div>  </div></ul><div><b>Map 1 , 2, 3 - Process flow:&nbsp;</b></div><div>Retrieved property data from Hope (not geo-located and with not practical BBL numbers) and from Ascendant (already geo-located but with projection issues)</div><div>Re-coded BBL numbers for both properties from scratch through padding numbers and concatenation</div><div>Conversion Tool - Convert Exl into Table</div><div>Table join between properties BBL and Mapluto BBLs for Manhattan but 6/100 properties did not join.
