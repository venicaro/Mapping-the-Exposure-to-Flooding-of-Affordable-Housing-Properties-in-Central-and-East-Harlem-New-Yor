<div></div><div></div><div>When compared to all the buildings in Central (3133) and East Harlem (4358), we see that the yearly rate of change in flooded buildings for East Harlem is 2%, lower than that of both H&amp;A properties.  Central Harlem's yearly rate of change is much higher (9.8%), because in 65 years the percentage of flooded buildings goes from 1% in 2015 to 5% in 2080.&nbsp; Overall, however, Central Harlem has a much smaller number of flooded building compared to numbers in East Harlem. </div><div></div><div></div><div>The spatial statistics performed on the digital elevation model revealed that the average elevation of the buildings that may flood in 2015 is 7.9 feet, in 2020 it is 11.6 feet, in 2050 it is 10.8 feet and in 2080 14.4 feet. Those that never flood under any scenario (31 properties) have a diverse range of elevations, going from 12 feet to 60 feet. This means that other factors rather than elevation should also be taken into account, because the mean elevation calculated here takes into account the building parcel and not  streets morphology. The table below compares the elevation results between Borough, H&amp;A properties and all the buildings in Central and East Harlem. A contributing factor to Hope Properties flooding more than Ascendants' is topographical elevation.&nbsp;Hope Properties are at lower median elevation (13.2 feet) than Ascendants (29 feet) and also lower than the median elevation of both Central (22 feet) and East Harlem (15 feet).</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><table><tbody><tr><td><div>Elevation (in feet)</div></td><td><div>Manhattan (DCP, 2018)</div></td><td><div>Hope</div></td><td><div>Ascendant</div></td><td><div>Central Harlem</div></td><td><div>East Harlem</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Mean</div></td><td><div>42.7</div></td><td><div>30</div></td><td><div>13.4</div></td><td><div>23.6</div></td><td><div>17.7</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Median </div></td><td><div>27</div></td><td><div>13.2</div></td><td><div>29</div></td><td><div>22</div></td><td><div>15</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Minimum</div></td><td><div>15</div></td><td><div>6.2</div></td><td><div>5.6</div></td><td><div>-</div></td><td><div>-</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Maximum</div></td><td><div>103</div></td><td><div>66.4</div></td><td><div>43.8</div></td><td><div>-</div></td><td><div>-</div></td></tr></tbody></table></div>
