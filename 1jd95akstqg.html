<div><b></b></div><div>The map will map exposure to climatic risks such as existing buildings in the 2015 100-year floodplain, those projected to be there in the 2050 project 100-year floodplain, Sandy Inundation levels, 2050s future sea level rise and more crucially, levels of inundation due to combined high tide-rainfall events and corresponding groundwater levels<a href="#_ftn1">[1]</a>. It will also need to contextualize flooding issues within broader neighborhood physical and socio-economic characteristics. Socio-economic indicators may include: vulnerable populations by age, sex and race, median household income and if available household expenditures on water, electricity, and food by income bracket (as percentage of total expenditures). &nbsp;Physical indicators may include, number of basements, number of basements that flood at least 1 a month (perhaps I need to define a risk ranking here), number of brownfields, e-sites, highways and truck routs, major sewage pipes, power plants, and waste treatment with potential to contaminate East Harlem during extreme weather events. For instance, the Place-Based Community Brownfield Planning Foundation Report On ‘Existing Conditions East Harlem, Manhattan (2016)’ reveals that in East Harlem, there are 25 records of Open Spills and 171 registrations of Petroleum Bulk Storage and E-Designations have been placed on 96 properties. Another contextual element that could be added through another thematic map is a map of responses to lessen the impacts of flooding on buildings by the OneNYC’s Mayor’s Office of Recovery and Resiliency (ORR) and other NYC agencies. </div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><a href="#_ftnref1">[1]</a> This depends on whether I can get projections data from a company currently working on modeling combined floods citywide. Even if I do, however, I fear the city may not allow for these projections to go public. </div>
