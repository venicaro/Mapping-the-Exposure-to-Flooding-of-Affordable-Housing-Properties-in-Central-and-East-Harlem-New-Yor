I figured out that some addresses that I had initially split into two (e.g. 242-244 East 106 Street) should be kept as one because splitting them generates a new BBL code that of course does not exist. After I joined the address back I solved 5 of 6 missing BBL which were not joining. </li><li>Selected all null (not joint attributes) and selected inverse to obtain only BBLs in CD 10 and 11, where properties are located. Exported data selection as shapefile. </li><li>Created 1 field per floodplain (2015, 2020, 2050) set with a short integer and all values at 0 (NOT IN FLOOPLAIN). From the FEMA 2015 I selected by attribute only the 100 year floodplain</li><li>Selected by location - from the BBL with condition of intersecting with floodplain 2015, 2020, 2050, 2080.

Another way I could have done this was to color code the chronology of flooding from green to red depending on 3 (floods in 2020), 2 (floods in 2050), 3 (floods in 2080) but I realized I also needed to distinguish the properties.
