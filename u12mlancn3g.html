I figured out that some addresses that I had initially split into two (e.g. 242-244 East 106 Street) should be kept as one because splitting them generates a new BBL code that of course does not exist. After I joined the address back I solved 5 of 6 missing BBL which were not joining. </li><li>Selected all null (not joint attributes) and selected inverse to obtain only BBLs in CD 10 and 11, where properties are located. Exported data selection as shapefile. </li><li>Create 1 field per floodplain (2015, 2020, 2050) set with a short integer and all values at 0 (NOT IN FLOOPLAIN)</li><li>Selected by location - from the BBL with condition of intersecting with floodplain 2015, 2020, 2050, 2080.
