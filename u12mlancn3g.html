I figured out that some addresses that I had initially split into two (e.g. 242-244 East 106 Street) should be kept as one because splitting them generates a new BBL code that of course does not exist. After I joined the address back I solved 5 of 6 missing BBL which were not joining. </li><li>Selected all null (not joint attributes) and selected inverse to obtain only BBLs in CD 10 and 11, where properties are located. Exported data selection as shapefile. </li><li>Created 1 field per floodplain (2015, 2020, 2050) set with a short integer and all values at 0 (NOT IN FLOODLAIN). From the FEMA 2015 I selected by attribute only the 100 year floodplain</li><li>Selected by location - from the BBL with condition of intersecting with floodplain 2015, 2020, 2050, 2080. Each time I selected with field calculator BBLs that intersected with each floodplain and I assigned  the intersection at 1 (IN FLOODPLAIN)</li><li>Created another column where I aggregated all numbers to understand the BBLs that fall in the floodplain at none, one, two or all projections.</li><li>I decided to represent the different floodplains in three colors and code the properties (1 Ascendant; 0 Hope) and assign different colors to both. Another way I could have done this was to color code the chronology of flooding from green to red depending on 3 (floods in 2020), 2 (floods in 2050), 3 (floods in 2080) but I realized I also needed to distinguish the properties. I tried do choose "Many values" under Symbology and assign both coding for floodplain and coding for type of property (distinguishing them through a specific pattern applied to a solid color). The result was not satisfying because, especially in the overall map the zoom levels are not appropriate to show the details of the patterning. </li><li>Exported Attribute table to Excel and performed a yearly rate of change analysis on the total number of buildings exposed to different floodplains as well as yearly rate of change for each property type. I used the following formula:</li></ol><div>=(<b>new_value</b>-<b>original_value</b>)/ABS(original_value)</div><div>where&nbsp;<b>original_value</b> represents the value that the percentage of change is based on, and&nbsp;<b>new_value</b> represents the value that has changed, and ABS is an Excel function returning the absolute value of a number. </div><div>I then divided what I obtained by the number of years (2080-2015) that is 65</div><div></div><div><b>Maps 2, 3, 4, 5&nbsp; - Small Multiple maps of single floodplains</b></div><ul><li>Created 3 small multiple maps showing a zoomed in version of Map 1.
