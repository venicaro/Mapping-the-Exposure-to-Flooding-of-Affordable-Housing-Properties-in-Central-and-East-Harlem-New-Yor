I figured out that some addresses that I had initially split into two (e.g. 242-244 East 106 Street) should be kept as one because splitting them generates a new BBL code that of course does not exist. After I joined the address back I solved 5 of 6 missing BBL which were not joining. </div><div>Selected all null (not joint attributes) and selected inverse to obtain only BBLs in CD 10 and 11, where properties are located.
