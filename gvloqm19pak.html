<div></div><h2 data-label="709692" class="ltx_title_subsection">Results and Conclusions</h2><div>In this project I asked three questions: 1) How many Hope and Ascendant properties are in the current and future floodplain and how does this relate to topography? How do Hope and Ascendant buildings compare with the rest of the buildings in Manhattan? and 3) What is the average elevation of flooded and not flooded BBL under different floodplains?</div><div>To answer question 1, the results show that in the 2015 FEMA Floodplain 20% of Hope's buildings flood, while 12% of Ascendant's flood. In the NYPCC 2020 projected floodplain 37% of Hope's&nbsp; and 31% of Ascendant's properties are flooded. Under the NYPCC 2050 projected floodplain 57% of Hope's and 35% of Ascendant's are flooded. Finally under the NYPCC 2080 projected floodplain 84% of Hope's and 38% of Ascendant's properties are flooded. Hope's properties have a higher yearly rate of change (4.9%) than Ascendant's (3.6%) but this may be due to the fact that there's more Hope has more properties (78) than Ascendant (26). Aside from 2 properties owned by Ascendant, all the other  properties fall within East Harlem. When compared to all the buildings in Central (4358) and East Harlem (7491), we see that the yearly rate of change for East Harlem is&nbsp;</div><div></div><div></div><div></div>
