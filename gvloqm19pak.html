<div></div><h2 data-label="709692" class="ltx_title_subsection">Results and Conclusions</h2><div>In this project I asked three questions: 1) How many Hope and Ascendant properties are in the current and future floodplain and how does this relate to topography? How do Hope and Ascendant buildings compare with the rest of the buildings in Manhattan? and 3) What is the average elevation of flooded and not flooded BBL under different floodplains?</div><div>To answer question 1, the results show that in the 2015 FEMA Floodplain 20% of Hope's buildings flood, while 12% of Ascendant's flood. In the NYPCC 2020 projected floodplain 37% of Hope's&nbsp; and 31% of Ascendant's properties are flooded. Under the NYPCC 2050 projected floodplain 57% of Hope's and 35% of Ascendant</div><div></div><div></div><div></div>
