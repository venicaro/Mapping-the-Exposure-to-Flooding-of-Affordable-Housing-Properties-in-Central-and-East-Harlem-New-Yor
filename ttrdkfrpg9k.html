<div></div><div>The table below summarizes all the results so far, adding the yearly rate of change in flooded buildings. Hope's properties have a higher yearly rate of change (4.9%) than Ascendant's (3.6%) but this may be due to the fact that  Hope has more properties (78) than Ascendant (26) in the sample.&nbsp;Aside from 2 properties owned by Ascendant, all the other  properties fall within East Harlem. The yearly rate of change of Hope properties is also more than double than that of East Harlem (2%). Central Harlem's yearly rate of change is much higher (9.8%), because in 65 years the percentage of flooded buildings goes from 1% in 2015 to 5% in 2080.&nbsp;  I conclude that Hope Properties may be more exposed to flooding under current and future floodplain than Ascendant Properties and may also be more exposed than all the building in East Harlem.</div><div></div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><table><tbody><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>Hope Properties</td><td>Ascendant Properties</td><td>Central Harlem</td><td>East Harlem</td></tr><tr><td>Total Number of Buildings </td><td>78</td><td>26</td><td>4358</td><td>3133</td></tr><tr><td>% flooded in 2015</td><td>20%</td><td>12%</td><td>1%</td><td>29%</td></tr><tr><td>% flooded in 2020</td><td>37%</td><td>31%</td><td>2%</td><td>43%</td></tr><tr><td>% flooded in 2050</td><td>57%</td><td>35%</td><td>4%</td><td>51%</td></tr><tr><td>% flooded in 2080</td><td>84%</td><td>38%</td><td>5%</td><td>65%</td></tr><tr><td>Yearly Rate of Change</td><td>4.9%</td><td>3.6%</td><td>9.8%</td><td>2%</td></tr></tbody></table></div>
