<div></div><div>The spatial statistics performed on the digital elevation model revealed that the average elevation of the buildings that may flood in 2015 is 7.9 feet, in 2020 it is 11.6 feet, in 2050 it is 10.8 feet and in 2080 14.4 feet. Those that never flood under any scenario (31 properties) have a diverse range of elevations, going from 12 feet to 60 feet. This means that other factors rather than elevation should also be taken into account, because the mean elevation calculated here takes into account the building parcel and not  streets morphology.
