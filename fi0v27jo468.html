I used Zonal Statistics via Table, where under "Input raster or feature zone data" I selected the H&amp;A BBLs properties, in&nbsp;Zone field I selected 'BBL' under "Input value raster" the DEM clipped and mask to Central and East Harlem.&nbsp; Under statistics type I choose MEAN and I repeated the operation to obtain the MEDIAN elevation of the properties. I made a Table join on "BBL" between the table produced by zonal statistics  and the table with H&amp;A properties. I then opened the table and on MEAN I chose ' Summarize SUM Floodplain' to the average MEAN elevation and saved it outside the geodatabase as text file so I could work it on Excel.&nbsp; The result is a table that expresses the average elevation at which BBLs flooded under different flood scenarios.&nbsp;</div>
