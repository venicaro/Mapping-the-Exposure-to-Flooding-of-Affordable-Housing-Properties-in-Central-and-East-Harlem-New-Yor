Geo-spatial technologies are used to estimate the risk of occurrence of a disaster based on physical and/or social dimensions. These two dimension are brought together in the concept of risk, which is a function of exposure, social vulnerability and the ability to recover of different social groups to flooding&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Ka_mierczak_2011}</cite>.&nbsp; Although there may be many variables influencing exposure to floods, here I refer to exposure as the susceptibility to being affected by an environmental related hazard&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Cutter_2005,Cutter_2012}</cite>, such as a flood event, based on area topography, proximity to the floodplain and rainfall trends. </div>
