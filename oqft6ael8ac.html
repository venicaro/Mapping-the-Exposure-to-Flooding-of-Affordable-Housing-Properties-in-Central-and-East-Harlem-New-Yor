<div></div><div> Among the NYC's corporations owning&nbsp; stock of affordable rental housing are Hope and Ascendant.<a href="http://www.hopeci.org/content/property-management"> Hope’s Property Management Department services</a> and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ascendant.nyc/" target="_blank">Ascendant</a> Neighborhood Development (AND) are two community-based not-for-profit affordable housing organization based in East and Central Harlem.&nbsp; Both organizations advocate for the preservation of affordable housing in New York City, "as rapid increases in market-rate residential and commercial development  propel speculation, drive up rents, and encourage tenant harassment and  displacement" (AND website). Just  22  percent  of  rental units in New York City are affordable to&nbsp;households whose annual income is below $30,000. Both organizations also work to strengthening the neighborhood's social fabric by assisting in the growth and success of local businesses, by assisting residents to enhance their lives and incomes, and by sponsoring community programs.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><a href="http://www.hopeci.org/content/property-management">Hope&nbsp;</a>owns over 1,300 affordable apartments in more than 78 buildings throughout Central and East Harlem (Community District 10 and 11). AND owns over 628 apartments in 28 buildings.&nbsp; During a meeting at the New School both Hope and Ascendant, expressed the need for evidence-based mapping to understand the exposure to flooding to their properties. Following a meeting with Hope, one of the main problems seems to be ‘blue sky flooding’, the type of flooding occurring without stormy weather and influenced by high tides at seas, high ground water table and surface elevation. There is evidence that this type of flooding affects basements, which are recurrently flooded, but for which Hope has very little funding for left over after what goes towards regular building maintenance. Moreover, Hope has been receiving a number of&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ewa.bh/en/Customer/MeterReading/violations">violations</a> from  ConEd, NYC's energy company, because as flooding affects basements, officers cannot access gas and water readings&nbsp; stored there. Because of these violations, Hope has been unable to close housing retrofitting deals with the for-profit-banks they partner with. At the same time Hope has been an early adopter of green rooftops, thanks to funding made available by the city, however green rooftops address a different problem: they slow down excess rainfall but they do not slow down water coming from below, or from coastal surges. </div><div></div><div>This project aims at a large scale mapping of the vulnerability to coastal flooding  of both Hope and Ascendant properties. GIS will be used for this purpose. GIS and remote sensing are critical tools for analyzing, preparing for, mitigating, and responding to natural and human-induced disasters, including from flooding events&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Huang_2009}</cite><cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Strobl_2012}</cite>. Geo-spatial technologies are used to estimate the risk of occurrence of a disaster based on physical and/or social dimensions.
