<div></div><div> Among the NYC's corporations owning&nbsp; stock of affordable rental housing are Hope and Ascendant.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.hopeci.org/content/property-management" target="_blank">Hope’s Property Management Department services</a> and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ascendant.nyc/" target="_blank">Ascendant</a> Neighborhood Development (the latter referred to as AND from now onwards) are two community-based not-for-profit affordable housing organization based in East and Central Harlem.&nbsp; Both organizations advocate for the preservation of affordable housing in New York City, "as rapid increases in market-rate residential and commercial development  propel speculation, drive up rents, and encourage tenant harassment and  displacement" (AND website). Just  22  percent  of  rental units in New York City are affordable to&nbsp;households whose annual income is below $30,000. Both organizations also work to strengthening the neighborhood's social fabric by assisting in the growth and success of local businesses, by assisting residents to enhance their lives and incomes, and by sponsoring community programs.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><a href="http://www.hopeci.org/content/property-management">Hope&nbsp;</a>owns over 1,300 affordable apartments in more than 78 buildings throughout Central and East Harlem (Community District 10 and 11). AND owns over 628 apartments in 28 buildings.&nbsp; During a meeting at the New School both Hope and Ascendant, expressed the need for evidence-based mapping to understand the exposure to flooding to their properties. Following a meeting with Hope, one of the main problems seems to be ‘blue sky flooding’, the type of flooding occurring without stormy weather and influenced by high tides at seas, high ground water table and surface elevation. There is evidence that this type of flooding affects basements, which are recurrently flooded, but for which Hope has very little funding for left over after what goes towards regular building maintenance. Moreover, Hope has been receiving a number of&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ewa.bh/en/Customer/MeterReading/violations">violations</a> from  ConEd, NYC's energy company, because as flooding affects basements, officers cannot access gas and water readings&nbsp; stored there. Because of these violations, Hope has been unable to close housing retrofitting deals with the for-profit-banks they partner with. At the same time Hope has been an early adopter of green infrastructure, like green rooftops and gardens, thanks to funding made available by the city. However, green rooftops address a different problem: they slow down excess rainfall but they do not slow down water coming from below, or from coastal surges.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>The results and final map(s) were shared with all staff at Hope and Ascendant as a tool for advocacy around issues of flooding of their properties. Initially we thought it  was going to be possible to access data on occurrence of flooding in  basements from the building manager service&nbsp;<a href="https://sitecompli.com/" target="_blank">SiteCompli</a>.  This website contains information about the violations that both  organization incur year round since 2012. A close inspection of the data  contained revealed that violations are filed for issues such as "sewer  backup" but no further explanation is given about whether the violation  was filed because inspectors could not access the basement. The number  of complaints&nbsp; related to sewer backup was also too small to warrant  visualization through GIS mapping (36 complaint between 2010 and 2018).  So far violations descriptions are not capturing important information about whether the violation is issued as a result of the inability of inspectors to access the basement due to to flooding.&nbsp; A short protocol for Hope and Ascendant Property managers will be produced  in order to file more accurate descriptions of violations occurring as&nbsp; consequence of flooding. The long term dream is&nbsp;                  to be able to quantify the hidden recurrent costs due to basement flooding that add to the burden of regular maintenance costs.   &nbsp;</div><div></div><h2 data-label="680016" class="ltx_title_subsection">A Framing for Flood Vulnerability in New York City</h2><div>This project aims at a large scale mapping of the vulnerability to coastal flooding  of both Hope and Ascendant properties. GIS is used for this purpose. GIS and remote sensing are critical tools for analyzing, preparing for, mitigating, and responding to natural and human-induced disasters, including from flooding events&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Huang_2009}</cite><cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Strobl_2012}</cite>. Geo-spatial technologies are used to estimate the risk of occurrence of a disaster based on physical and/or social dimensions. These two dimensions are brought together in the concept of risk, which is a function of a hazard, the exposure to it and social vulnerability, defined below after&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citet{Rosenzweig,Ka_mierczak_2011}</cite>.&nbsp; Although there may be many variables influencing exposure to floods, here I refer to exposure as the susceptibility of people, properties and systems to being affected by an environmental related hazard&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Cutter_2005,Cutter_2012}</cite>, which in this case is understood to be the current and projected floodplain in Central and East Harlem, New York City. We furthermore consider as elements of exposure the number of affordable housing buildings and their topographical elevation.&nbsp; In terms of socio-economic vulnerability, we considered three variables that can compound the threat of CDCs housing units to present and coastal flooding in East Harlem.  In East Harlem the percentage of people living below the federal poverty level is slightly higher (22%) than the mean for the whole city of New York (20.5%, U.S. Census, 2010), and research shows that people living in poverty and who are socially marginalized have reduced capacity for self-protection in terms of mitigating flood hazards at home pre-event, evacuating&nbsp; in response to flooding, or returning home or to employment in the aftermath of a flooding event, accessing social protection such as flood insurance, hazard mitigation infrastructure, emergency response information and assistance&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Collins_2009,Collins_2012,Elliott_2006,Maldonado_2015}</cite>.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>The second variable of socio-economic vulnerability is related to the benefits and drawbacks of urban rezoning plans. Changes in land use zoning and floor area ratio (FAR) permits can have important impacts on neighborhoods’ populations by increasing property costs &nbsp;and influencing housing careers, skewing access to services and utilities, affecting the distribution of parks and public space. Rezoning can lead to increased density and waste water pumping needs These impacts can lead to the progressive displacement of low-income socioeconomic groups but also of certain land-uses such as industrial land uses and manufacturing&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Curran_2007}</cite>. The changing of &nbsp;land uses can imply the loss of economic stability for working-class communities&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Wolf_Powers_2005}</cite> and their ability to equally access opportunities and privileges in society.&nbsp; In this study we pay attention to the urban blocks interested by the East Harlem Rezoning Plan approved by the New York City Council in 2017, and which is  expected to result in a net increase of approximately 3,500 dwelling  units, a substantial proportion of which are expected to be affordable. However, this portion may be allotted to for profit developers instead of CDCs, who can guarantee to keep the rent to a level of affordability in line with the needs of the poorest segments of society. There is reason to believe that the East Harlem Rezoning will just hand over more of the affordable housing stock into the hands of property developers, reframing what affordability means by increasing the density of market rate housing or changing the ways in which local people can afford the amenities in their neighborhood. Over the past decade or so, New York city housing has been shifting in favor or more middle and high priced rentals, in a glaring erosion to the inventory of rent regulated housing&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{stringer2018}</cite>.</div><div></div><div>The third variable of socio-economic vulnerability is represented by the date of expiration of the affordable rent subsidy. In exchange for a government subsidy, privately owned, publicly subsidized rental hous agree to keep units  affordable to low- and moderate-income households for a set number of  years, typically 30 years. After a regulatory agreement expires,  however, owners can begin to rent their units at market rates.&nbsp; These expiring subsidies are offered through affordable housing by, at the federal level, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the city level, by the NYC Housing and Preservation (HPD). We account the subsidy expiration as a possible socio-economic vulnerability because, should the subsidy fail to be renewed the tenants risk rent spikes or eviction&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>This large scale mapping project aimed to answers the following questions:&nbsp;</div><ol><li>How many Hope and Ascendant properties are in the current and future floodplain?</li><li>How do Hope and Ascendant buildings compare with the rest of the buildings in Central and East Harlem?</li><li>What is the average elevation of flooded and not flooded BBL under different flood scenarios?</li><li>Where are high or low socio-economic vulnerability clusters located within East Harlem?</li></ol><div></div>
