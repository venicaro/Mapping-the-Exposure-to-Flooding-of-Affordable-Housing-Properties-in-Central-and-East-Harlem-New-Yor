<div></div><div> Among the NYC's corporations owning&nbsp; stock of affordable rental housing are Hope and Ascendant.<a href="http://www.hopeci.org/content/property-management"> Hope’s Property Management Department services</a> and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ascendant.nyc/" target="_blank">Ascendant</a> Neighborhood Development (AND) are two community-based not-for-profit affordable housing organization based in East and Central Harlem.&nbsp; Both organizations advocate for the preservation of affordable housing in New York City, "as rapid increases in market-rate residential and commercial development  propel speculation, drive up rents, and encourage tenant harassment and  displacement" (AND website). Just  22  percent  of  rental units in New York City are affordable to&nbsp;households whose annual income is below $30,000. Both organizations also work to strengthening the neighborhood's social fabric by assisting in the growth and success of local businesses, by assisting residents to enhance their lives and incomes, and by sponsoring community programs.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><a href="http://www.hopeci.org/content/property-management">Hope&nbsp;</a>owns over 1,300 affordable apartments in more than 78 buildings throughout Central and East Harlem (Community District 10 and 11). AND owns over 628 apartments in 28 buildings.&nbsp; During a meeting at the New School both Hope and Ascendant, expressed the need for evidence-based mapping to understand the exposure to flooding to their properties. Following a meeting with Hope, one of the main problems seems to be ‘blue sky flooding’, the type of flooding occurring without stormy weather and influenced by high tides at seas, high ground water table and surface elevation. There is evidence that this type of flooding affects basements, which are recurrently flooded, but for which Hope has very little funding for left over after what goes towards regular building maintenance. Moreover, Hope has been receiving a number of&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ewa.bh/en/Customer/MeterReading/violations">violations</a> from  ConEd, NYC's energy company, because as flooding affects basements, officers cannot access gas and water readings&nbsp; stored there. Because of these violations, Hope has been unable to close housing retrofitting deals with the for-profit-banks they partner with. At the same time Hope has been an early adopter of green rooftops, thanks to funding made available by the city, however green rooftops address a different problem: they slow down excess rainfall but they do not slow down water coming from below, or from coastal surges. </div><div></div><div>This project aims at a large scale mapping of the vulnerability to coastal flooding  of both Hope and Ascendant properties. GIS will be used for this purpose. GIS and remote sensing are critical tools for analyzing, preparing for, mitigating, and responding to natural and human-induced disasters, including from flooding events&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Huang_2009}</cite><cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Strobl_2012}</cite>. Geo-spatial technologies are used to estimate the risk of occurrence of a disaster based on physical and/or social dimensions. These two dimension are brought together in the concept of risk, which is a function of exposure, social vulnerability and the ability to recover of different social groups to flooding&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Ka_mierczak_2011}</cite>.&nbsp; Although there may be many variables influencing exposure to floods, here I refer to exposure as the susceptibility to being affected by an environmental related hazard&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Cutter_2005,Cutter_2012}</cite>, such as a flood event, based on selected variables such as area topography, proximity to the floodplain. More on the procedures utilized is presented in Methods &amp; Analysis.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>This project answers the following questions: </div><ol><li>How many Hope and Ascendant properties are in the current and future floodplain?</li><li>How do Hope and Ascendant buildings compare with the rest of the buildings in Manhattan?</li><li>What is the average elevation of flooded and not flooded BBL under different floodplains?</li></ol><div></div><div>The results and final map(s) were shared with all staff at Hope and Ascendant as a tool for advocacy around issues of flooding of their properties. The project understood that, so far, violations descriptions are not capturing important information about whether the violation is issued as a result of the inability of inspectors to access the basement due to to flooding (see Study Limitations).&nbsp; A short protocol for Hope and Ascendant Property managers is produced to use in order to file more accurate descriptions of violations occurring as&nbsp; consequence of flooding. The long term dream is&nbsp;                  to be able to quantify the hidden recurrent costs due to basement flooding that add to the burden of regular maintenance costs.    &nbsp;</div><div></div><h3 data-label="975256" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">Study Limitations</h3><div>There was one major limitation to this project. Initially I thought it was going to be possible to access data on occurrence of flooding in basements from the building manager service <a href="https://sitecompli.com/" target="_blank">SiteCompli</a>. This website contains information about the violations that both organization incur year round since 2012. A close inspection of the data contained reveals that violations are filed for issues such as "sewer backup" but no further explanation is given about whether the violation was filed because inspectors could not access the basement. The number of complaints&nbsp; related to sewer backup was also too small to warrant visualization through GIS mapping (36 complaint between 2010 and 2018). Therefore </div>
